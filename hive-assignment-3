1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location

3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table

4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 

5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"


Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year
b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
d. In which quarter sales was minimum
e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold



***********************************************solutions for above mentioned queries*****************************************************************


step-1
 Download or copy vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv
 
 
step-2 
store that raw data into hdfs location 
command -> vim sales_order_data.csv
        -> paste that  vehicle sales data
        
step-3
Create an internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv

first create data base
command ->  create database hive_assign;
        ->  use hive_assign;
        
then create table "sales_order_csv" to store csv data "sales_order_csv"
command -> > Create table sales_order_csv
    > (order_no int,
    >  quantity_ordered int,
    >  price_each DOUBLE,
    >  order_line_no int,
    >  sales double,
    >  status string,
    >  qtr_id int,
    >  month_id int,
    >  year_id int,
    >  product_line string,
    >  msrp int,
    >  product_code string,
    >  phone string,
    >  city string,
    >  state string,
    >  postal_code string,
    >  country string,
    >  territory string,
    >  lastname string,
    >  firstname string,
    >  deal_size string)
    >  row format delimited
    >  fields terminated by ','
    >  tblproperties ("skip.header.line.count"="1");

step-4
Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv"
command->  load data local inpath 'file:///home/cloudera/data/sales_order_data.csv/' into table sales_order_csv;

step-4
Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc
command->
